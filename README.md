# ESSIS2024
Build your own web crawler in Python

Abstract: Basic knowledge of programming concepts has been an integral part of information sciences for a long time. With minimal knowledge of language syntax and by using only necessary parts of the language, it is possible to quickly and efficiently create a tool that will selectively gather data from multiple web sources. That is precisely the goal of this workshop. The first part of the workshop will present the basic programming concepts, while the second part will demonstrate how this concept can be applied to data collection from web sources. Targeted data will be collected from the initial pages of the web sources on the given list. The programming language used is Python, and the workshop is intended for beginners.
